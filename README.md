  > Halp, I'm Stuck! The helpdesk app for Hack Reactor peer support

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Target Audience ##
  > Hack Reactor students can already elevate problems to Hackers In Residence. Now they can submit tickets to their peers first.

## Summary ##
  > Hack Reactor students use Slack for everything communication, including appealing to their peers for tech support. This results in a very cluttered slack that is difficult to follow if you are checking in on posted issues. Enter the Halp Desk, where students can submit helpdesk tickets for their peers to solve in an atmosphere dedicated to organizing those requests and removing the confusion as to the status of the issue. Students can submit tickets and other students can view the issue and offer support. The student who created the ticket can then close the ticket when resolved and no one will have to question as to whether it is still an issue. It will also offer a database students can search if they come across an issue again, thus creating a stack overflow of sorts over time.

## Problem ##
  > Hack Reactor students are always slacking their problems and appealing to their peers for support. It is difficult, however, to tell if an issue has been resolved and it clutters the Slack channel.

## Solution ##
  > By moving the peer-support communication out of Slack, the clutter in Slack will be alleviated. Creating an interface that allows users to see if issues are still issues, it will also alleviate the confusion that comes with text messaging due to lack of details.

## Quote from the CEO ##
  > "You've been using peer-support since you arrived. Get ready to do it better."

## How to Get Started ##
  > To get started, all you have to do is log in and post your requests. It could not be simpler.

## What the Customers are Saying ##
  > "I've been asking for halp for weeks but now I feel like I'm truly getting the halp I need. Thanks Halp Desk!"

## Next Steps ##
  > Log in and get to posting!
